## Introduction

This Tic Tac Trivia! game can be used for both recreation and education. 

For recreation, it provides additional facets that will challenge the players in ways that standard trivia games does not.  The addition of the timer and the tac toe style 3-in-a-row challenge increases the level of competition and skill. In addition, the ability to select the difficulty level will provide a challenge to the novice and seasoned trivia buff and everyone in between.

For education, it provides a fun study alternative for students.  This Open Trivia API allows one to submit their own questions (this can be done by a teacher or student).  Once populated, students can challenge each other to a friendly competition style study session.  

## Code Samples

The following is just an example of our end to end design process starting with requirements, concept development, coding and implementation.

## Features and Functionality

Used Open Trivia API and AJAX to import trivia questions with different categories and levels of difficulty.
 
Used Firebase to provide real time communication between players including chat.
 
Used Formspree API to implement the "Invite a Friend" functionality. Since this required inputting the email address, user input validation was used.
 
Using a combination of bootstrap, materialize, animate, and custom css we were able to create a polished UI that is mobile responsive.
 
In addition to the existing knowledge base of the team, they pushed themselves to incorporate new technologies into the design.  They considered several solutions for their product and through trial and error they settled on Materalize and Animate.  In addition, they built on their knowledge of mobile responsiveness technologies and delve into viewport measurements to meet that requirement.
 
All code has been reviewed to ensure that it adheres to good quality coding standards including layout, indentation, syntax and grammar.
